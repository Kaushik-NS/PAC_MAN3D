This project is a 3D Pac-Man game built in Unity, based on classic Pac-Man gameplay.
The player navigates a maze, collects pellets and gold tokens, avoids ghosts, and uses power
dots to temporarily eat enemies.
The game demonstrates:
• NavMesh-based enemy AI
• Player movement and collision handling
• Collectible systems (pellets, power dots, gold tokens)
• UI feedback and score tracking
• Basic win/lose conditions
